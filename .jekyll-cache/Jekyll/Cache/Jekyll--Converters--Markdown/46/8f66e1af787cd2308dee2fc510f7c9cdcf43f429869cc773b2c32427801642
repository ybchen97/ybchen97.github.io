<p>I am an undergraduate Computer Science Major currently studying at National University of Singapore. I really enjoy learning computer science as it is both challenging and fun, and I get to build stuff with my skills, which is a huge plus! In my free time, I like to dance, read and exercise.</p>

<p>This website serves as a journal to record down my thoughts and reflections as I progress through my 4 years of undergraduate study in NUS. Sometimes, I also write reviews of interesting or impactful modules that I have taken in the passing semester.</p>
