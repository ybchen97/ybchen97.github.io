<em>Whatâ€™s this? Plot progression? So glad I kept the cadet badge, thought I almost lost itâ€¦</em></p>

<p>I sorely underestimated the amount of workload needed to be a TA for CS1101S, and the meager number of hours that the professor estimated for us didnâ€™t help either. I was told that it only takes 2 hours per week to prepare the teaching materials, 2 hours to mark the weekly assignments, and 2 hours to actually teach, so total I would be spending up to 6 hours a week fulfilling my TA duties.</p>
