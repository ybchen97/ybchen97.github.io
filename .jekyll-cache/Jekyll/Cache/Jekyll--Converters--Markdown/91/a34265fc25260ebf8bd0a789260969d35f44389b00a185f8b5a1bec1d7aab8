<em>What‚Äôs this? Plot progression? So glad I kept the cadet badge, thought I almost lost it‚Ä¶</em></p>

<p>It‚Äôs time again for another round of after-semester reflections.</p>

<h2 id="being-a-teaching-assistantta-for-cs1101s">Being a Teaching Assistant(TA) for CS1101S</h2>

<p>I sorely underestimated the amount of workload needed to be a TA for CS1101S, and the meager number of hours that the professor estimated for us didn‚Äôt help either. I was told that it only takes 2 hours per week to prepare the teaching materials, 2 hours to mark the weekly assignments, and 2 hours to actually teach, so total I would be spending up to 6 hours a week fulfilling my TA duties. Well‚Ä¶only one of the estimates is correct, and it is only correct because my teaching slot is 2 hours long.</p>

<p>CS2105 really showed me how much I could possibly dislike a boring module. I still remember how frustrated I was trying to study for it. It‚Äôs not really the professor‚Äôs fault, since he still taught the concepts pretty decently, but the concepts were just too superficial that you‚Äôd naturally lose interest in it after a few days.</p>
