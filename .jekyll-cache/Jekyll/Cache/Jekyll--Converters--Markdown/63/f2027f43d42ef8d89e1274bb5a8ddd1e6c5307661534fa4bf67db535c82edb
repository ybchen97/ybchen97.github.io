      <p class="project-description">Orbiboy is a project about developing a Gameboy emulator that runs on modern web browsers. The emulator is written entirely in C++, and subsequently compiled into WebAssembly via Emscripten to be deployed on our website. This project is done together with Tan Yi Heng as part of a school project under National University of Singapore called Orbital.</p>
