I"‰<p>Hello!</p>

<p>This is my very first (and hopefully not the last) post on this blog. I have been wanting to write a blog of some sorts to keep track of my thoughts and reflections for quite sometime, but I never actually took the time to do it. A few days ago I decided to finally throw away my procrastination and get down to the dirty work, and this is the first piece of the result that Iâ€™ve been working on for the past day or two. Note that this website is actually built using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. I simply took one of available themes offered on Jekyll, edited the code a little and this is the website. Credits to <a href="https://github.com/LeNPaul/Lagrange">Paul Le</a> for designing such an amazing theme.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-this-blog-about">What is this blog about?</h2>

<p>I personally think it is quite important to reflect regularly as it allows us to properly digest the many events that happen in our daily lives and, potentially, gain some insights about ourselves from them. So this blog aims to be a simple collection of my thoughts and reflections of things that happened in my life. In addition, I would also like to write reviews of modules that I have read in the past semester, as a way to gather what I have learnt from them.</p>

<p>Well, Iâ€™m looking forward to seeing where this goes.</p>
